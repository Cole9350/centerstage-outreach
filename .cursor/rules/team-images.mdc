# Team Images Guidelines

## Image Placeholders
All team pages currently use placeholder images that need to be replaced:
- Path: `/images/placeholder.jpg`
- Board/Staff: Circular images (w-48 h-48)
- Members: Rectangular images (h-64)

## Image Requirements
When replacing placeholders:
1. Board & Staff Photos:
   - Square aspect ratio
   - Minimum size: 400x400px
   - Circular crop in UI
   - Professional headshots preferred

2. Team/Group Photos:
   - Landscape orientation
   - Minimum height: 400px
   - Group shots showing all members
   - Consistent style across teams

## Image Naming Convention
Use the following format for image files:
- Board: `board-[lastname].jpg`
- Staff: `staff-[lastname].jpg`
- Teams: `team-[company-name].jpg`

Example:
- `/images/board-legrow.jpg`
- `/images/staff-prout-leitao.jpg`
- `/images/team-senior-sagamore.jpg`

## Image Optimization
Before adding images:
1. Compress to reduce file size
2. Convert to WebP format if possible
3. Maintain aspect ratios
4. Ensure consistent quality across all images
